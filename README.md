**We wanted to make a better way to take medicine that would help all people.
Some people cannot take their medicine on their own or depend on others to help them.
With our product there is a software docotrs can set the dosage and timing for
medication, making it safe and secure for all. We also want this product to be something that
can work for everyone, so the alert system consist of a vibration motor, speaker, and led to
include alerting for everyone. It then uses a servo to dispense the ammount of pills needed and locks
back after use.**
